# Front-End-Portfolio-Project


Hello Users! Welcome to the Yugioh Card Search Project!

Here in our website we have two webpages for you. One will welcome you to our website, and direct you to the yugioh card search page!

In our YuGiOh card search page, you will be able to search the name or part of a name of a card and be returned results in a list format. Upon clicking on one of those names within the list the user will be able to obtain information on the card as well as be displayed the cards image.

This is a great way for Yu-Gi-Oh lovers to learn even more about the cards they have, or have yet to see/play with.
